# WordPress CMS website for Comic Book Stores

This project's purpose is to create a website that can be used by local comic book shops. It also served to familiarize myself with WordPress.

The Website allows the owner(s) of the store to update its customers with events the store is having, new available inventory, blog sections for 'Comic of the week' and 'Random News', and basic store informations such as directions and store hours. 

Having even the most basic website wil allow the owners to increase customer traffic, customer loyalty, and customer interaction.
